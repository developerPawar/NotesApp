# NotesApp

This is a notes app built with 4 additional features added apart from the existing features from React markdown editor (react-mde-11.5.0).
The list of 4 additional features are as follows - 
1. Sync notes with local storage (browser storage)
2. Add custom note summary titles to the sidebar note headings instead of the default (#Note1, #Note2)
3. Move recently modified notes to the top of the list
4. Delete notes
